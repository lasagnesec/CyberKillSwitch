Domain Registration Kill Switch

Uses dnsapi.lib function [DnsQuery_A](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/windns/nf-windns-dnsquery_a) to ensure a domain is registered.

This is PoC code and doesn't do anything further than that, ideally it would be used to execute other functions if the website exists.

This is a similar function to that seen in WannaCry.
